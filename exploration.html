            <h2>Exploring the Red Planet</h2>
            <p>For decades, scientists have sent sophisticated robots to study Mars up close. From the first successful flyby in 1965 to the current rovers and orbiters, each mission has uncovered new secrets about this fascinating world.</p>

                    <h3>1960s-1970s</h3>
                    <p>The first successful Mars flyby was Mariner 4 in 1965. This mission provided the first close-up images of the Martian surface. Viking 1 and 2 became the first spacecraft to successfully land on Mars in 1976.</p>

                    <h3>1990s-2000s</h3>
                    <p>Mars Global Surveyor mapped the planet from 1997-2006. The Pathfinder mission delivered the first rover, Sojourner, to Mars in 1997. In 2004, Spirit and Opportunity rovers began their missions, with Opportunity operating for over 14 years.</p>
