                    <p>Scientists and space agencies around the world are actively researching the possibility of establishing human settlements on Mars. The planet offers several resources that could support human life, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Water ice at the poles and possibly underground</li>
                        <li>Soil that could potentially be used for growing plants</li>
                        <li>Materials for constructing habitats</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, significant challenges remain, including protection from radiation, adapting to reduced gravity, and creating sustainable life support systems.</p>
